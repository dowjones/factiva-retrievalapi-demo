       "With one week left to go in the month, is Microsoft stock a buy in February? This fresh take on the long-term leader among tech stocks and growth companies pinpoints the fundamentals, technicals and fund ownership factors that are ... \"As colleague Andrew Bary wrote in this space last week, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Alphabet are estimated to spend $200 billion on AI this year, equal to about one quarter of their revenue,\" Randall Forsyth wrote in the \"Up & Down Wall Street\" column in Barron's in the Week of Feb. 17 issue. \"Given China-based DeepSeek's reported ability to produce an AI model for a fraction of the cost of U.S. AI companies, this raises questions about American exceptionalism, or at least the payoff from the billions U.S. tech giants are sinking into AI investments,\" Forsyth added. Earnings Remain Strong In terms of EPS Rating, Microsoft ranks No. 2 in its industry group behind Adobe. Going beyond the EPS Rating, Microsoft's profit picture looks solid but not spectacular. Wall Street consensus forecasts call for earnings in the current fiscal year ending in June to rise 11% to $13.15 a share, a slight downward revision. Still, that's more than quadruple what the firm earned in fiscal 2018 ($3.88). Fiscal 2026 earnings are seen accelerating slightly, up 14% to $14.95 a share. The company's return on equity in fiscal 2025 was terrific at 37%. IBD research has found that many of the great stock market winners showed an ROE of at least 17% at the start of their moves. During recent decades, ROEs have climbed past 20% among top growth stocks. Strong profit margins have also boosted MSFT's Sales + Margins + Return on equity (SMR) Rating to a stellar A on a scale of A to E.

Technical Action Today Looking at a monthly chart of Microsoft stock, the megacap tech is clearly not leading the stock market higher. Since reaching an all-time high of 468.35 in July, shares have treaded water, even as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq continued their course of higher highs and higher lows. On the positive side, Microsoft stock has gotten support at 400, a psychologically important round number for investors. Let's check out the weekly chart. It shows a eight-month consolidation pattern in the works. Microsoft stock is trading 11% off its peak. But it's also trading below its 10-week and 40-week moving averages, a no-no for any stock that is preparing to break out of a good base and launch a run of new highs. A great stock normally trades above these technical levels right before a powerful breakout to new highs — the best time to grab shares for growth investors. Who Are The Future Microsofts of The Market? Check These Key Growth Stock Lists Microsoft's Strength Vs. Rest Of Market Another way to get a handle on the technical action? Consider using IBD's unique Relative Strength Rating. Compared with all other companies in the IBD database, Microsoft stock currently gets a lowly 35 Relative Strength Rating. This means Microsoft has outperformed only 35% of all stocks over the past 12 months. Four weeks ago, it was a mediocre 58; six months ago, the RS stood at 71. MarketSurge, meanwhile, notes a 30 score for the six-month RS Rating. And the three-month rating? Also weak at 31. This means Microsoft stock has outperformed only 31% of all companies in the IBD database over the past three months. Picking the best growth stocks absolutely involves selecting those that are already outperforming their peers before they stage a new strong run. When a stock breaks out of a well-formed base, you normally want to see the Relative Strength Rating exceed 80 on a scale of 1 to 99. In some cases, when the base gets extra long (think six months or longer), you can expect the rating to be lower than 80. It's not uncommon for excellent large and megacap stocks to bust out of bases and race to new highs even though their RS ratings are in the 50s or 60s. Microsoft Stock And Institutional Sponsorship Finally, fund sponsorship remains favorable and is perhaps the strongest leg in the three-legged stool of analyzing Microsoft in terms of fundamental, technical and institutional ownership criteria."

      "This Magnificent Seven Tech Loses More Ground After Gaining On New Quantum Chip; Is Microsoft Stock A Buy In February? - 2025-02-25 - - With one week left to go in the month, is Microsoft stock a buy in February? This fresh take on the long-term leader among tech stocks and growth companies pinpoints the fundamentals, technicals and fund ownership factors that are ... \"As colleague Andrew Bary wrote in this space last week, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Alphabet are estimated to spend $200 billion on AI this year, equal to about one quarter of their revenue,\" Randall Forsyth wrote in the \"Up & Down Wall Street\" column in Barron's in the Week of Feb. 17 issue. \"Given China-based DeepSeek's reported ability to produce an AI model for a fraction of the cost of U.S. AI companies, this raises questions about American exceptionalism, or at least the payoff from the billions U.S. tech giants are sinking into AI investments,\" Forsyth added. Earnings Remain Strong In terms of EPS Rating, Microsoft ranks No. 2 in its industry group behind Adobe. Going beyond the EPS Rating, Microsoft's profit picture looks solid but not spectacular. Wall Street consensus forecasts call for earnings in the current fiscal year ending in June to rise 11% to $13.15 a share, a slight downward revision. Still, that's more than quadruple what the firm earned in fiscal 2018 ($3.88). Fiscal 2026 earnings are seen accelerating slightly, up 14% to $14.95 a share. The company's return on equity in fiscal 2025 was terrific at 37%. IBD research has found that many of the great stock market winners showed an ROE of at least 17% at the start of their moves. During recent decades, ROEs have climbed past 20% among top growth stocks. Strong profit margins have also boosted MSFT's Sales + Margins + Return on equity (SMR) Rating to a stellar A on a scale of A to E.

Technical Action Today Looking at a monthly chart of Microsoft stock, the megacap tech is clearly not leading the stock market higher. Since reaching an all-time high of 468.35 in July, shares have treaded water, even as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq continued their course of higher highs and higher lows. On the positive side, Microsoft stock has gotten support at 400, a psychologically important round number for investors. Let's check out the weekly chart. It shows a eight-month consolidation pattern in the works. Microsoft stock is trading 11% off its peak. But it's also trading below its 10-week and 40-week moving averages, a no-no for any stock that is preparing to break out of a good base and launch a run of new highs. A great stock normally trades above these technical levels right before a powerful breakout to new highs — the best time to grab shares for growth investors. Who Are The Future Microsofts of The Market? Check These Key Growth Stock Lists Microsoft's Strength Vs. Rest Of Market Another way to get a handle on the technical action? Consider using IBD's unique Relative Strength Rating. Compared with all other companies in the IBD database, Microsoft stock currently gets a lowly 35 Relative Strength Rating. This means Microsoft has outperformed only 35% of all stocks over the past 12 months. Four weeks ago, it was a mediocre 58; six months ago, the RS stood at 71. MarketSurge, meanwhile, notes a 30 score for the six-month RS Rating. And the three-month rating? Also weak at 31. This means Microsoft stock has outperformed only 31% of all companies in the IBD database over the past three months. Picking the best growth stocks absolutely involves selecting those that are already outperforming their peers before they stage a new strong run. When a stock breaks out of a well-formed base, you normally want to see the Relative Strength Rating exceed 80 on a scale of 1 to 99. In some cases, when the base gets extra long (think six months or longer), you can expect the rating to be lower than 80. It's not uncommon for excellent large and megacap stocks to bust out of bases and race to new highs even though their RS ratings are in the 50s or 60s. Microsoft Stock And Institutional Sponsorship Finally, fund sponsorship remains favorable and is perhaps the strongest leg in the three-legged stool of analyzing Microsoft in terms of fundamental, technical and institutional ownership criteria.\n",
