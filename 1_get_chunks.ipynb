       "\n",
       "**Tariff Decisions:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Initial Announcement:** On April 2nd, the US administration announced drastically increased tariffs on virtually all trading partners [5, 4].\n",
       "*   **Partial Halt:** Implementation of the increased tariffs was later halted for most countries, except for China, with a uniform 10% tariff remaining in place for other trading partners [4].\n",
       "*   **China Tariffs:** Tariffs on Chinese goods took effect, with China retaliating significantly by placing tariffs on the US [5, 4]. China retaliated in virtually the same way, and placed tariffs on the USA of 125 percent, after the USA increased tariffs on China to 145 percent overall [4].\n",
       "*   **Broader Strategy:** The tariff announcements were part of a broader strategy to compel foreign governments to reduce trade barriers to American goods, targeting non-tariff barriers like agricultural regulations, taxation systems, currency practices, product standards, legal frameworks, and customs procedures [5]. Countries were given a three-month deadline to make concessions or face new tariffs ranging from 10% to over 50% [5].\n",
       "\n",
       "**Impact on the World Economy:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Global Economic Slowdown:** The IMF indicated that the tariff increases and uncertainty would lead to a significant slowdown in global growth in the near term [4]. The IMF downgraded its global growth projection for 2025 to 2.8% and 3% in 2026, down from 3.3% in the January 2025 forecast [8, 4].\n",
       "*   **US Economic Contraction:** The US economy contracted by 0.3% in the first quarter of 2025, the first contraction since early 2022 [6, 2]. This was partly attributed to businesses rushing to import goods ahead of the tariffs [2]. Net exports subtracted nearly 5 percentage points from headline GDP, the biggest quarterly drag since 1947 [2].\n",
       "*   **Trade Deficit:** The US international trade deficit widened to a record $140.5 billion in March as companies rushed to import foreign products before tariffs were imposed [7, 1]. Year-to-date, the trade deficit had doubled from the previous year [1].\n",
       "*   **Uncertainty and Business Impact:** Companies like Ford, Cummins, and Mattel withdrew or suspended their financial outlooks due to economic uncertainty driven by tariffs [3]. Ford estimated tariff-related costs would reduce pretax earnings by $1.5 billion [3]. Tyson Foods saw tariffs and economic uncertainty slicing into Americans' appetite for steaks [3].\n",
       "*   **Inflation:** President Trump’s tariffs are expected to push inflation higher in the coming months [10].\n",
       "*   **Impact on Specific Countries:**\n",
       "    *   **China:** China's factory activity fell as export channels were blocked [6].\n",
       "    *   **Pakistan:** Pakistan faced a 29% tariff on its exports to the US, potentially impacting its textile industry [9].\n",
       "    *   **Australia:** The IMF trimmed its forecast for Australian economic growth in 2025 by half a percentage point [8].\n",
       "*   **Stock Market Volatility:** Financial-market volatility continued due to on-off tariff announcements [2].\n",
