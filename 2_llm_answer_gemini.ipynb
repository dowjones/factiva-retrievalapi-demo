       "Over the last few months, the US administration has made several tariff decisions impacting the automotive industry worldwide. These decisions include the doubling of steel and aluminum tariffs, the imposition of new tariffs on imported vehicles and auto components, and the negotiation of specific trade agreements.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Tariff Decisions by the US Administration:**\n",
       "*   **Increased Steel and Aluminum Tariffs:** The Trump administration has doubled tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50% [1, 3, 6].\n",
       "*   **Auto Import Tariffs:** A 25% import tariff on cars has been in place [7, 10].\n",
       "*   **Tariffs on Indian Auto Products:** The US adopted a 25% ad valorem tariff increase on imports of passenger vehicles, light trucks, and certain automobile parts originating from India, effective May 3, 2025, for an unlimited duration [4, 6, 9].\n",
       "*   **UK Trade Agreement:** A recent trade agreement with the US includes a 100,000 quota for a 10% tariff on car imports from the UK [5].\n",
       "*   **Call for Domestic Parts Manufacturing:** President Trump has expressed a desire for parts manufacturing to return to the US [7].\n",
       "\n",
       "**Impact on the Automotive Industry Worldwide:**\n",
       "\n",
       "**On the US Automotive Market and Consumers:**\n",
       "*   **Sales Volatility:** Consumers rushed to purchase new cars and trucks in March and April 2025 to avoid tariff-related price increases, driving sales to a four-year high (17.8 million annual rate in March). However, this surge was followed by a nearly 10% drop in May, with sales returning to a more typical pace (15.6 million annual rate) [1, 2].\n",
       "*   **Increased Costs and Prices:** Rising costs of imported goods and domestic steel have compelled some carmakers to raise prices [1]. The average price for a new vehicle in May 2025 was $45,462 [2]. Doubling steel and aluminum tariffs could add approximately 5% to cumulative tariff costs, potentially exceeding $7,000 per car [3].\n",
       "*   **Consumer Confidence:** Concerns about inflation and the impact of higher tariffs have contributed to low consumer confidence [2].\n",
       "*   **Inventory Challenges:** Dealers have begun running out of vehicles acquired before the tariffs took effect [1].\n",
       "*   **Uncertainty and Outlook:** Economists predict slower and more uneven growth for the US economy due to trade fights [1]. Ford, for instance, suspended its regular forecast of future sales and profits due to this uncertainty [1]. Auto sales in March are anticipated to be the high point of the year, with a slowdown expected before a rebound next year [1].\n",
       "\n",
       "**On Global Automotive Manufacturers and Trade Relations:**\n",
       "*   **Manufacturing Costs:** The increased metals tariffs are expected to raise manufacturing costs for carmakers in the US and complicate efforts to build and sell more vehicles [1, 3].\n",
       "*   **Company-Specific Impacts:**\n",
       "    *   **Toyota:** Reported that US tariffs added $1.25 billion to its costs in April and May 2025, as it imports about 45% of the vehicles it sells in the US [2].\n",
       "    *   **Mazda:** Experienced a 19% plunge in sales in May, largely due to its reliance on imports [2].\n",
       "    *   **Korean Automakers (Hyundai Motor, Kia, GM Korea):** Face a \"double whammy\" of declining exports and domestic slump, with the 25% US auto tariff expected to cause significant earnings damage [10]. Abolishing this tariff is a top priority for South Korea in its trade negotiations with the US [10].\n",
       "    *   **Ford, General Motors, Stellantis:** Their stock prices have been negatively affected by tariff concerns [3, 7].\n",
       "*   **Supply Chain Challenges:** The push for domestic parts manufacturing poses a long-term challenge, as it is difficult to produce all components within the US, particularly lower-value parts or those no longer manufactured there (e.g., LED displays) [7]. Low-cost parts are crucial for keeping new-car prices affordable [7].\n",
       "*   **International Trade Disputes:**\n",
       "    *   **India:** Has sought consultations with the US at the World Trade Organization (WTO) over the 25% tariffs on passenger vehicles, light trucks, and auto components, arguing these are unnotified safeguard measures. India has reserved the right to impose retaliatory duties and seeks compensation [4, 6, 9]. India's auto component exports to the US were estimated at $6.8 billion in FY24 [6].\n",
       "    *   **Mexico:** Mexican companies are increasingly utilizing the Mexico-United States-Canada Agreement (T-MEC) to ensure tariff-free access to the US market, as the US has imposed significant tariffs on other trading partners [8]. The T-MEC requires 75% regional content for automobiles to qualify for preferential treatment [8]. Without T-MEC, average tariffs for Mexican automotive exports to the US would be substantially higher (8.1%) [8].\n",
       "    *   **United Kingdom:** While a recent trade agreement with the US provides a 100,000 quota for a 10% tariff on car imports, which Jaguar Land Rover considers the \"best deal\" under the circumstances, the UK steel industry faces significant revenue losses compared to Europe due to price divergence caused by US tariffs [5].\n",
