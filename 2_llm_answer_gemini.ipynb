       "During April and May 2025, the US administration made several tariff-related decisions impacting the automotive industry, including Tesla.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Tariff Decisions:**\n",
       "*   In April 2025, Tesla reported that \"shifting trade policies, exacerbated by the administration's tariff regime,\" were stressing supply chains and increasing costs for the automaker. The company was also \"contending with 25% tariffs imposed on auto imports\" [8, 9, 10].\n",
       "*   By early May 2025, President Donald Trump \"altered his auto tariff policies, giving manufacturers some relief on imported parts\" [7].\n",
       "*   On May 8, 2025, details emerged of a trade deal between President Trump and the U.K., which included \"smaller tariffs on imports of vehicles from Britain\" [1].\n",
       "*   Over the weekend preceding May 13, 2025, U.S. and Chinese officials announced a \"90-day pause on steep import tariffs\" following talks in Switzerland. These tariffs were previously \"north of 100%\" [3].\n",
       "\n",
       "**Impact for Tesla:**\n",
       "*   **Costs and Margins:** Tesla, while assembling all cars sold domestically in the U.S. and having lower direct tariff exposure than many automakers, still faces tariffs on imported parts [2, 7]. Elon Musk noted that \"tariffs are still tough on a company when margins are still low\" [2, 7]. Tesla's first-quarter operating profit margin was 2%, its weakest since the second quarter of 2019 [2, 7]. The company imports some battery cells from China and over 20% of its components from Mexico, which adds to costs due to tariffs [8, 10].\n",
       "*   **Sales and Demand:** The ongoing \"trade fight\" and \"changing political sentiment\" were cited as factors that could weigh on demand for Tesla's vehicles [8, 9, 10]. President Trump's trade war has led Chinese car buyers to favor local models, impacting Tesla's sales in China [1, 5]. Tesla's sales in China were down about 15% year-over-year over the five weeks ending May 4, and down about 2% in the first quarter of 2025 [1, 5]. Chinese EV sales dropped almost 9% year-over-year in April, and Tesla's Chinese sales were down 56% year-over-year in May (as of May 13) [3]. Weak second-quarter China sales were also linked to U.S.-China trade tensions [6].\n",
       "*   **Stock Performance:** The announcement of smaller tariffs in the U.S.-U.K. trade deal was seen as a \"boon for all auto makers,\" contributing to a 3.1% rise in Tesla stock on May 8 [1]. Furthermore, the 90-day pause on U.S.-China import tariffs led to a significant boost for Tesla's stock, which rose 6.7% on May 12, as investors welcomed the easing of trade tensions [3].\n",
