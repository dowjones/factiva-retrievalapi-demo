       "The US administration has recently implemented or threatened several tariff decisions impacting the automotive industry worldwide.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Tariff Decisions by the US Administration:**\n",
       "*   **Steel and Aluminum Tariffs:** President Trump plans to double existing tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50% from 25%, effective June 4, 2025 [2, 5]. These tariffs were initially applied on March 12, 2025 [5].\n",
       "*   **General Automotive Import Tariffs:** There is an existing 25% import tariff on cars [6, 9]. President Trump has also threatened broader tariffs on automotive imports [1].\n",
       "*   **Automotive Imports from India:** On March 26, 2025, the US adopted a measure to increase tariffs by 25% ad valorem on imports of passenger vehicles, light trucks, and certain automobile parts originating from India. This measure for auto parts became effective on May 3, 2025, and applies for an unlimited duration [3, 5, 8, 10].\n",
       "*   **UK Trade Agreement:** A recent trade agreement with the US includes a 100,000-unit quota for a 10% tariff on car imports from the UK into the US [4].\n",
       "*   **Domestic Parts Manufacturing:** President Trump expects automotive parts manufacturing to return to the US, giving the industry approximately one year to adjust its supply chains [6].\n",
       "\n",
       "**Impact on the Automotive Industry Worldwide:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Increased Costs and Prices:**\n",
       "    *   The planned doubling of steel and aluminum tariffs to 50% is expected to significantly increase manufacturing costs for carmakers in the US [2]. One estimate suggests this could add approximately 5% to cumulative Trump tariff costs, reaching over $7,000 per car [2].\n",
       "    *   Toyota reported that US tariffs added $1.25 billion to its costs in April and May [1].\n",
       "    *   Carmakers have begun raising prices to offset tariffs, particularly after existing pre-tariff inventory was sold [6].\n",
       "    *   The push for domestic parts manufacturing poses a long-term challenge, as it is difficult to produce all parts in the US, especially lower-value components or those no longer manufactured domestically (e.g., LED displays). This could impact the affordability of new cars [6].\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Sales and Consumer Behavior:**\n",
       "    *   Concerns about inflation and the impact of higher tariffs have weighed on consumer confidence, which remains near a record low [1].\n",
       "    *   Despite low consumer confidence, Americans continue to purchase vehicles, with 1.2 million units sold in May, roughly in line with the previous year [1]. A rush of buying occurred in late March and April as consumers sought to get ahead of threatened automotive import tariffs [1].\n",
       "    *   Americans spent around $53.8 billion on new vehicles in May, a 7% increase from a year prior, with an average price of $45,462 [1].\n",
       "    *   Sales performance varied among manufacturers: Ford (up 16%), Toyota (up 11%), Honda (up 7%), Hyundai (up 8%), and Kia (up 5%) reported gains, while Mazda, which heavily relies on imports, saw its sales plunge 19% [1].\n",
       "    *   In Korea, domestic sales for Hyundai Motor, Kia, KG Mobility, and GM Korea dropped in May, partly attributed to the US 25% auto tariff impacting exports [9].\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Financial Market Reactions:**\n",
       "    *   Auto stocks, including Toyota, Stellantis, Ford, and General Motors, experienced declines globally following news of the planned steel and aluminum tariff increases, as investors worry about increased costs and the impact on demand [2, 6].\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **International Trade Relations and WTO Challenges:**\n",
       "    *   India has formally challenged the US 25% tariffs on passenger vehicles, light trucks, and auto components from India at the World Trade Organization (WTO) [3, 5, 8, 10]. India argues these are \"safeguard measures\" that the US failed to notify to the WTO and is seeking consultations and potential compensation [3, 5, 8, 10]. India's auto component exports to the US were estimated at $6.8 billion in FY24 [5].\n",
       "    *   India had previously reserved the right to impose retaliatory duties on US products in response to steel and aluminum tariffs [3, 5].\n",
       "    *   Korea's auto industry faces a \"double whammy\" of declining exports due to the US 25% auto tariff and a domestic slump. Abolishing this auto tariff is Korea's top priority in ongoing trade negotiations with the US [9].\n",
       "    *   The UK's steel industry is experiencing a divergence in prices compared to the EU due to US tariffs, leading to an estimated £100-150 million annual revenue loss for UK companies like Tata Steel, indicating that the EU is moving faster to defend its industry against US tariffs [4].\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Supply Chain Adjustments:**\n",
       "    *   Mexican companies are increasingly utilizing the Mexico-United States-Canada Agreement (T-MEC) to secure tariff-free access to the US market, particularly for trucks (nearly 100%), cars (80%), and auto parts (over 50%) [7].\n",
       "    *   The T-MEC requires 75% regional content for automobiles to qualify for tariff-free access [7]. While some steel and aluminum products face 25% tariffs and cars 15% under T-MEC, the agreement generally provides preferential treatment compared to non-treaty exports, which would face higher tariffs (e.g., an average of 8.1% for Mexican automotive exports without T-MEC) [7].\n",
